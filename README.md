# Memory Card Game
A classic memory card game.
https://captbobo.github.io/memory-game/

## How to play 

Click/tap on the card you want to flip. When you flip a card you'll see the symbol on its back. 

On the screen, there are always two cards with the same symbol. And your mission is to find the pairs of cards for each symbol. Reveal symbol pairs in as little moves as possible before the time runs out!

You can reset the cards and the timer with the button labelled as "Reset" at the top right corner of the screen.

Don't worry about the timer, it will start only after you flip the first card of a game instance.

## Compatibility

This game is designed to work well in all browsers through all screen types and sizes. However, to get the best experience I recommend using Google Chrome.

## A11y

This game is not designed to be played with assistive technologies such as screen readers. 
I think a better version of this game can be created to be played with such technologies.
