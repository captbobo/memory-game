# Memory Card Game

My take on a classic game.

https://captbobo.github.io/memory-game/

For game is still in development phase, its: 
- not optimized for all screen sizes
- not compatible for all browsers
- not optimized for a11y (tab-index, alt-text for icons)

and it's: 
- modal is not fully styled
- scoring display is not pretty
- game-over messages are not customized
