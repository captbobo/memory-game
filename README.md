# Memory Card Game

My take on a classic game.

https://captbobo.github.io/memory-game/

For game is still in development phase, it's: 
- not optimized for all screen sizes
- not optimized for all browsers

and its:
- modal is not fully styled
- scoring display is not pretty
- game-over messages are not customized
